## Project Title

A simple contract to store the details about our coin.

## Description

In this project we have to create a simple contract in which the contract will have public variables which will store the details about our coin (Token Name, Token Abbrv., Total Supply), our contract will have a mapping of addresses to balances (address => uint). And we will have a mint function that takes two parameters: an address and a value. The function then increases the total supply by that number and increases the balance of the “sender” address by that amount. Our contract will have a burn function, which works the opposite of the mint function, as it will destroy tokens. It will take an address and value just like the mint functions. It will then deduct the value from the total supply and from the balance of the “sender”. Lastly, the burn function should have conditionals to make sure the balance of "sender" is greater than or equal to the amount that is supposed to be burned.
